### coeur
{: ._expander-title}

[coeur](npmjs.com/package/coeur) is a patchwork design system, style guide, prototyping tool, and build system. Itâ€™s powerful, and is what this site (and all the other projects) are built on top of. It emphasizes reliably and quickly producing minimally-valuable projects, and is built with Middleman, Github, surge.sh, vue.js, and SCSS.
